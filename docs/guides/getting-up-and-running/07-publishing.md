It's important to commit your code to Git every time you make a significant change to your code.

When you push your changes to GitHub, a GitHub Action will run that automatically builds and pushes any changes to Rivet's servers.

1. Open GitHub Desktop. You should see the change you made in the body.

2. Add a message for your commit and click *Commit to main*. The message should be informative about the changes you just made.
3. You should now see a button that says *Push origin*. Click it.
4. One finished pushing, you will see a new workflow running on GitHub. You can click it to see more details.

5. Wait for the GitHub Action run to complete. This should take 1-2 minutes. Validate that it shows a green check indicating the run succeeded.
