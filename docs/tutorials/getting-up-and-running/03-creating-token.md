Rivet provides a way for you to run your game on your local machine for development. In order to do this, we need to create a development token that will be used to securely authenticate your development machine with Rivet's servers.

1. Click on the sidebar button titled *API*. This page is used to manage API tokens which are used to securely authenticate with Rivet's servers.

2. Under the group titled *Staging*, click the button named *Create Development Token*. When prompted, set *Hostname* to 127.0.0.1 and create a port mapped from *5000 ‚Üí 80*. Click *Create* once complete.

    üí° Rivet development tokens are designed to make your development environment mimic your production environment. This configuration panel lets you configure how your development environment is configured.
    In our case, we run our game server on port 5000 locally but on port 80 in production.

3. When prompted, click the *Download Environment File* button. Save this file to `tanks-typescript-canvas-socketio/.env`. The file will be downloaded as `_env`, so make sure to rename it to `.env` once downloaded.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è When we refer to `tanks-typescript-canvas-socketio`, we're referring to the folder you cloned in GitHub Desktop in step 1.

    üí° Environment files are a way of exposing environment variables to a program in development.

    <aside>
    üí° The `.env` file is in the `.gitignore`, so this file will always stay on your local machine. [Read more about .gitignore files.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files)

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not share your development tokens with anybody. Development tokens give you access to privileged API endpoints.
